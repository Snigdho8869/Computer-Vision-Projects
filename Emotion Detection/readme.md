# Facial Emotion Detection 


This repository contains code for real-time facial emotion detection using a MobileNet pre-trained model and webcam feed. The model is trained on the facial expression dataset which consists of 224x224 grayscale images of faces labeled with seven emotions - anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral. The model achieved a validation accuracy of 67.65%.

# Requirements:

* Python 3

* OpenCV

* TensorFlow

* Keras

* NumPy


# Results: 

* The system achieved a validation accuracy of 67.65% in recognizing 7 different emotions

* The emotions detected are displayed on the screen in real time.

* In real-world scenarios, the accuracy may vary depending on various factors such as lighting conditions, facial expressions, and camera angles.
